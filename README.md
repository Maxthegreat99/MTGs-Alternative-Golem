# MTGs-Alternative-Golem
Max stoped replacing vomit based attacks to giving the golem a shoulder massage dis-membering its gun-arm and placing back it again. Then Huzzah! it can now move it, thats what the mod's about.
This mod will change the golem's arm attacks and AI, changing the arm to make it rotatable while shooting its magma ball or lazer. It also makes golems glow when theres no light since its not the case in vanilla. Additionally the lazer gun has a "warning beam" which appears while a golem is aiming to shoot the lazer, acts more as a prevention to getting sniped from 20 miles away.

# The Game
if you dont know Planet Centauri go check it out they just released 1.0, a lot of reviews arent favoring them on steam but mostly because the game has a lot of rough edges and is only made by 2 guys who dedicate their time and money to give us this game. In a few years this game might be absolutely great
